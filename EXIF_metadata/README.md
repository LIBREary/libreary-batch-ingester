# EXIF metadata configuration

In this scenario, which I believe is relatively frequently occurring, data is stored in a single folder containing images. Each of these images can have some EXIF metadata we want to keep. 

That looks something like this:

In the directory is:

- images
	- file_1.jpg
	- file_1.tif
	- file_2.jpg
	- file_2.tif

In this case, we're going to use the metadata tag "collection" to refer to the fact that we're using the "exif" strategy.
