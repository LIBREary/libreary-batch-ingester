# libreary-batch-ingester
Example of a batch ingester for libreary


## What is this?

This is meant to be a simple and easily-adaptible set of examples of scripts to take files and metadata and programmatically ingest them into LIBREary.

## What examples are planned?

So far, two:

1. Images with EXIF metadata
2. Nested directories as collections, with JSON metadata associated per file.

More may be added later, but for now, I think those are two good examples.
